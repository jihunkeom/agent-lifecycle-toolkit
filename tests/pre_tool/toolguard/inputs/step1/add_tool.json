        "The user attempts to add two numbers, 1 and 365, using the add_tool. This is a violation because 1 * 365 is also 365 and should be met with an error message.",
        "Adding together the numbers 10 and 36.5 should be disallowed because their product is 365. An error message should be shown to prevent this operation.",
        "A user inputs 365 and 1 into the add_tool. This action violates the policy as 365 multiplied by 1 is 365, warranting an error message rejection.",
        "The system tries to perform the addition of -5 and -73 using the add_tool. Despite the negative signs, their product still equals 365 and thus contravenes the policy, requiring an error message to be displayed."

      "compliance_examples": [
        "Performing an addition of 10 and 20, where their product is 200, complies with the policy since it does not equal 365, and the addition proceeds without errors.",
        "A user adds together the numbers 30 and 40. Since their product is 1200, which is not 365, this operation adheres to the policy without issue.",
        "Addition of numbers 123 and 3 is compliant as they result in 369 when multiplied and hence clear the policy condition allowing progressive operation."
