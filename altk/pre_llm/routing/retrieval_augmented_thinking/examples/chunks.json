    "Every day we are exposed to sounds from televisions, radios, and even traffic. Usually these sounds are present at safe volumes that do not affect our hearing. However, when exposed to sounds that are too loud or that last too long, hearing can be damaged. Conduct this simulation to understand how sound waves affect structures similar to the human ear.

    "- Hearing loss\n- Sensory perception",
    "The ear is an organ that serves two distinct functions-hearing and equilibrium. Hearing is our perception of energy carried as sound waves. Sound waves are alternating pressure waves with peaks of compressed air and valleys of diffuse air. Sound is a person's interpretation of the amplitude, frequency, and duration of the sound waves (see Figure 1).",
    "Figure 1. Sound waves consist of peaks of compressed air and valleys of diffuse air.  \n<!-- image -->",
    "Sound is characterized by pitch and loudness. Pitch is interpreted as high and low sounds. Our brain interprets lowfrequency waves with low-pitched sounds and high-frequency waves with high-pitched sounds. Loudness, which will be studied in this activity, is characterized by sound intensity and is also influenced by the sensitivity of an individual's ear. The intensity of a sound wave is a",
    "ear. The intensity of a sound wave is a function of the wave amplitude . Intensity is measured in decibels (dB) (see Figure 2). Normal conversation has a noise level of around 60 dB. At concerts the music is often projected around 120 dB. This intensity places listeners in danger of damage to their hearing. The amount of damage depends on the duration and frequency of the noise.",

    "Electronic music players such as iPods \u00ae  and other MP3 players are commonly used among teens. These electronic devices have the potential to produce noise levels that can cause damage to the ear. A recent study revealed that more than half the population of teenagers in the United States experienced ringing in their ears. Tinnitus is a condition characterized by the perception of ringing,",
    "by the perception of ringing, buzzing, hissing, and other noises, even in the absence of sounds. It can be caused by ear infections and as a result of noise-induced hearing damage.",
    "In order to understand how hearing loss can occur it is important to understand the anatomy of the ear. The structures of the inner ear include delicate hairs called cilia . Cilia bend in response to pressure waves; this movement sends signals to the brain. Cilia bend and then can break when exposed to loud sounds (classified as sounds &gt; 80 dB) especially if the noise is extremely loud or if",
    "if the noise is extremely loud or if it occurs over an extended period of time. Once cilia break, they cannot repair themselves. Resting the ears by avoiding loud sounds for extended periods of time allow the bent cilia in the ear to recover from the pressure created by the excessive noise.",

    "Audiologists, professionals who diagnose and treat hearing loss, recommend limiting exposure to loud noises whenever possible. This includes turning down the volume of music players and decreasing the amount of continuous time exposed to them. Other methods of protecting hearing are earplugs, use of high-quality headphones, turning the volume down, resting ears between sessions, and not smoking.",
    "ears between sessions, and not smoking. Smoking restricts blood flow; therefore the cilia are not able to recover as quickly, causing breakage.",
    "If an audiologist suspects hearing loss, the patient is given an audiometry test. In addition to a physical examination, the Weber and Rinne tests may also be performed to determine the type of hearing loss. Hearing loss is divided into two main categoriesconductive and sensorineural. Conductive hearing loss occurs when sound is not conducted efficiently through the outer ear to the eardrum. It",
    "the outer ear to the eardrum. It usually results in a reduction of sound level or the inability to hear quiet sounds. Sensorineural hearing loss occurs when there is damage to the inner ear or to the nerve pathways from the inner ear to the brain. This occurs as a result of being over-exposed to loud noises. Sensorineural hearing loss also involves a reduction in sound level, but also affects",
    "in sound level, but also affects speech understanding, or ability to hear clearly.",
    "Both the Weber and Rinne tests use a 512- or 1024-Hz tuning fork. During the Weber test a vibrating tuning fork is placed in the middle of the subject's forehead. The sound will seem louder in the ear with conductive hearing loss. If the sound seems to be evenly distributed between both ears it may indicate proper hearing or symmetrical hearing loss (equal loss in both ears). The Rinne test is",
    "loss in both ears). The Rinne test is conducted in addition to the Weber test to determine if the hearing loss is sensorineural. The vibrating tuning fork is placed directly on the mastoid process (the back side of the ear) until sound is no longer heard. Then the fork is immediately moved to the outside of the ear. Subjects with normal hearing or sensorineural hearing loss will hear the sound",
    "hearing loss will hear the sound longer through air than through bone. If the subject has conductive hearing loss, her or she hears the sound longer through bone than air.",
